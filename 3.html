    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.<br>
        Alongside <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong> is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.<br>
        It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.<br>
        Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
